# Hi I'm Nero!
... or Sebastian if you want! :)

I am an IT-apprentice from Germany ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª currently working for INNIUS DÃ– GmbH.\
I have started as a power user, went to became an IT administrator, yet over time my interests and main focus at work shifted over to coding starting with small scripts and ending in small programs for now.

Apart from coding I have a broad knowledge in IT - mainly security, end-user management and networking.

My goal is to get started in project/team management or to just be a very versatile programmer!
