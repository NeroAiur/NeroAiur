# Hi I'm Nero!
... or Sebastian if you want! :)

I am an Media Information Science student from Germany ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª currently working for queo GmbH.\
I have started as a power user, went to became an IT administrator, yet over time my interests and main focus at work shifted over to coding starting with small scripts and ending in small programs, now having working on my position as frontend and backend dev!

Apart from coding I have a broad knowledge in IT - mainly security, end-user management and networking.

My goal is to get started in project/team management or to just be a very versatile dev!
